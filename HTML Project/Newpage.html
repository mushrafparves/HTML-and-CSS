                    Apple Inc. is an American multinational technology company that specializes in consumer electronics, 
                    software and online services headquartered in Cupertino, California, United States. 
                    Apple is the largest technology company by revenue (totaling US$365.8 billion in 2021) and as of June 2022, 
                    it is the world's biggest company by market capitalization, the fourth-largest personal computer vendor by unit sales and second-largest mobile phone manufacturer. 
                    It is one of the Big Five American information technology companies, alongside Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft.<br><br>
                    Apple was founded as Apple Computer Company on April 1, 1976, by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak and Ronald Wayne to develop and sell Wozniak's Apple I personal computer. 
                    It was incorporated by Jobs and Wozniak as Apple Computer, Inc. in 1977 and the company's next computer, the Apple II, became a best seller. 
                    Apple went public in 1980, to instant financial success. The company developed computers featuring innovative graphical user interfaces, including the original Macintosh, announced in a critically acclaimed advertisement, "1984", directed by Ridley Scott. 
                    By 1985, the high cost of its products and power struggles between executives caused problems. Wozniak stepped back from Apple amicably and pursued other ventures, while Jobs resigned bitterly and founded NeXT, taking some Apple employees with him.
